SELECT dept_name, COUNT(DISTINCT student_id)
FROM department
LEFT JOIN student
ON department.dept_id = student.dept_id
GROUP BY dept_name
ORDER BY COUNT(DISTINCT student_id) DESC, dept_name;


SOLUTION
SELECT dept_name, COUNT(DISTINCT student_id)  AS stud_ct
FROM department
LEFT JOIN student
ON department.dept_id = student.dept_id
GROUP BY dept_name
ORDER BY stud_ct DESC, dept_name;

GROUP BY and ORDER BY, you can all use alias!!!
