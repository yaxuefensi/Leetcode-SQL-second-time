First quickly reviewing the question. raise 2 questions
1) what's the time frame of this request_date, any limit on this timeline?
2) a sender may send more than 1 request to one receiver; and a accepter may accept the request more than 1 time.  should this
be 


SELECT
ROUND(
  IFNULL(
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (SELECT DISTINCT requester_id, accepter_id FROM request_accepted ) as A)
   /
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (SELECT DISTINCT sender_id, send_to_id FROM friend_request) as B),
  0)
,2) AS accept_rate;

Easier way:
SELECT
ROUND(
IFNULL(
(SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT requestor_id, accepter_id) FROM request_accepted)
/
(SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT sender_id, send_to_id) FROM friend_request),0),2) AS accept_rate;

2.
Can you write a query to return the accept rate but for every month?

SELECT month, ROUND(IFNULL(accept_ct/request_ct,0),2) AS accept_rate
FROM
(
SELECT month, COUNT(*) AS request_ct
FROM (SELECT DISTINCT sender_id, send_to_id, EXTRACT(YEAR_MONTH FROM request_date) AS month FROM friend_request)
GROUP BY month
) AS request
LEFT JOIN
(
SELECT month, COUNT(*) AS accept_ct
FROM (SELECT DISTINCT requester_id, accepter_id, EXTRACT(YEAR_MONTH FROM accept_date) AS month FROM request_accepted)
GROUP BY month
) AS accept
ON request.month = accept.month

How about the cumulative accept rate for every day?
