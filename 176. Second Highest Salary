first attempt wrong
SELECT Salary AS SecondHighestSalary
FROM Employee
ORDER BY Salary desc

Note:
several functions in SQL
1. ORDER BY ...DESC
2. LIMIT a  OFFSET b
3. IFNULL:  IFNULL(xx, 0/NULL)



SELECT 
  IFNULL(
   (SELECT Salary 
    FROM Employee
    ORDER BY Salary DESC
    LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1), 
  NULL) AS SecondHighestSalary
