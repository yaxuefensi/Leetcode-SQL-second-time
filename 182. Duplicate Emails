My:
SELECT DISTINCT Person1.Email
FROM Person AS Person1, Person as Person2
WHERE Person1.Email = Person2.Email;

SELECT DISTINCT Person1.Email
FROM Person AS Person1
Join Person AS Person2
ON Person1.Email = Person2.Email;

Better solution:
Should think of COUNT() when trying to get dulicates or unique visitor.

SELECT Email
FROM Person
GROUP BY Email
Having COUNT(Email)>1;
